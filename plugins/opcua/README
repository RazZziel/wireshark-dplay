Overview:
=========

OpcUa (OPC Unified Architecture) is a vendor and platform independent
protocol for automation technology. It is the successor of the
COM/DCOM based specifications OPC DA, OPC Alarm & Events, OPC HDA, etc.
It unifies all this technologies into a single protocol.

The specification describes abstract services that are independent
of the underlying protocol. For now there exist protocol mappings
to a Binary TCP based protocol and a SOAP based Webservice.
Also a hybrid version will be available where the Binary messages are transported
by a single webservice command called "Invoke".

More information about the technology you can find on
http://www.ascolab.com/index.php?file=ua&lang=en.

Protocol Mappings:
==================

Binary (TCP): The fastest and most flexible version (small footprint, no XML and SOAP necessary)
              can easily be tunneled (SSH, IPSEC, etc.), redirected, ...
SOAP version: Easy to implement with verious tools like .Net, JAVA, gSOAP, etc.
              Better to communicate through firewalls via HTTP.
SOAP with Binary Attchment: Combines the advantages of both.
              The messages are encoded as Binary, and transported via SOAP as binary
              attachment.

The OPC Foundation offers a free Opc Ua stack implementation in ANSI C
for all members. This stack implements the binary protocol as well
as the SOAP version. It's easily portable to different kinds of operating
systems from embedded devices to servers.
This makes it easy to implement Opc Ua applications based on this stack
and it is expected that the binary protocol will be the most used
protocol.
Nevertheless it's free to everbody to implement an own stack according
to the specification. An own implementation of the SOAP version 
should be easy with the various SOAP toolkits.

Known limitations:
==================

* Only the security policy http://opcfoundation.org/UA/SecurityPolicy#None is supported,
  which means the encryption and signing is turned off.
