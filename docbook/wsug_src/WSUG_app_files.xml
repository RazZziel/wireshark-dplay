  <section id="ChAppFilesCaptureFilesSection"><title>Capture Files</title>
    <para>
	To understand which information will remain available after 
	the captured packets are saved to a capture file,
	it's helpful to know a bit about the capture file contents.
    </para>
    <para>
	Wireshark uses the libpcap file format as the default format to save 
	captured packets; this format has existed for a long time and it's pretty simple.
	However, it has some drawbacks: it's not extensible and lacks some 
	information that would be really helpful (e.g. being able to add a comment
	to a packet such as "the problems start here" would be really nice).
    </para>
    <para>
	In addition to the libpcap format, Wireshark supports several different 
	capture file formats. However, the problems described above also applies 
	for these formats.
    </para>
    <para>
	A new capture file format "PCAP Next Generation Dump File Format"
	is currently under development, which will fix these drawbacks. 
	However, it still might take a while until the new file format is ready 
	and Wireshark can use it.
    </para>
  <section id="ChIOFileContentSection"><title>Libpcap File Contents</title>
    <para>
	At the start of each libpcap capture file some basic information is stored 
	like a magic number to identify the libpcap file format. 
	The most interesting information of this file start is the link layer type 
	(Ethernet, Token Ring, ...). 
    </para>
    <para>
	The following data is saved for each packet:
	<itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    the timestamp with millisecond resolution
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>

    <section id="ChAppFilesConfigurationSection"><title>Configuration Files and Folders</title>
    <para>
      Wireshark uses a number of files and folders while it is running. Some 
	  of these reside in the personal configuration folder and are used to 
	  maintain information between runs of Wireshark, while some of them are 
	  maintained in system areas.
    </para>
	<tip><title>Tip</title>
	<para>A list of the folders Wireshark actually uses can be found under the 
	<command>Folders</command> tab in the dialog box shown when you select 
	<command>About Wireshark</command> from the <command>Help</command> menu.
	</para>
	</tip>
    <para>
	The content format of the configuration files is the same on all platforms.
	However, to match the different policies for Unix and Windows platforms, 
	different folders are used for these files.

	data (typically something like: 
	<filename>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Local Settings</filename>)
