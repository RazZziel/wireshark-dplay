/*
 * Do this now, to get close() defined, before we muck with the definition
 * of HAVE_UNISTD_H.  See below for the full sad story of why we do that.
 */
#ifdef HAVE_UNISTD_H
#include <unistd.h>
#endif /* HAVE_UNISTD_H */

/*
 * OK, now this is tricky.
 *
 * At least on FreeBSD 3.2, "/usr/include/zlib.h" includes
 * "/usr/include/zconf.h", which, if HAVE_UNISTD_H is defined,
 * #defines "z_off_t" to be "off_t", and if HAVE_UNISTD_H is
 * not defined, #defines "z_off_t" to be "long" if it's not
 * already #defined.
 *
 * In 4.4-Lite-derived systems such as FreeBSD, "off_t" is
 * "long long int", not "long int", so the definition of "z_off_t" -
 * and therefore the types of the arguments to routines such as
 * "gzseek()", as declared, with prototypes, in "zlib.h" - depends
 * on whether HAVE_UNISTD_H is defined prior to including "zlib.h"!
 *
 * It's not defined in the FreeBSD 3.2 "zlib", so if we include "zlib.h"
 * after defining HAVE_UNISTD_H, we get a misdeclaration of "gzseek()",
 * and, if we're building with "zlib" support, anything that seeks
 * on a file may not work.
 *
 * Other BSDs may have the same problem, if they haven't done something
 * such as defining HAVE_UNISTD_H in "zconf.h".
 *
 * "config.h" defines HAVE_UNISTD_H, on all systems that have it, and all
 * 4.4-Lite-derived BSDs have it.  Therefore, given that "zlib.h" is included
 * by "file_wrappers.h", that means that unless we include "zlib.h" before
 * we include "config.h", we get a misdeclaration of "gzseek()".
 *
 * Unfortunately, it's "config.h" that tells us whether we have "zlib"
 * in the first place, so we don't know whether to include "zlib.h"
 * until we include "config.h"....
 *
 * A similar problem appears to occur with "gztell()", at least on
 * NetBSD.
 *
 * To add further complication, on recent versions, at least, of OpenBSD,
 * the Makefile for zlib defines HAVE_UNISTD_H.
 *
 * So what we do is, on all OSes other than OpenBSD, *undefine* HAVE_UNISTD_H
 * before including "wtap-int.h" (it handles including "zlib.h" if HAVE_ZLIB
 * is defined, and it includes "wtap.h", which we include to get the
 * WTAP_ERR_ZLIB values), and, if we have zlib, make "file_seek()" and
 * "file_tell()" subroutines, so that the only calls to "gzseek()" and
 * "gztell()" are in this file, which, by dint of the hackery described
 * above, manages to correctly declare "gzseek()" and "gztell()".
 *
 * On OpenBSD, we forcibly *define* HAVE_UNISTD_H if it's not defined.
 *
 * Hopefully, the BSDs will, over time, remove the test for HAVE_UNISTD_H
 * from "zconf.h", so that "gzseek()" and "gztell()" will be declared
 * with the correct signature regardless of whether HAVE_UNISTD_H is
 * defined, so that if they change the signature we don't have to worry
 * about making sure it's defined or not defined.
 *
 * DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, REMOVE THE FOLLOWING LINES, OR MOVE
 * THEM AFTER THE INCLUDE OF "wtap-int.h"!  Doing so will cause any program
 * using Wiretap to read capture files to fail miserably on a FreeBSD
 * 3.2 or 3.3 system - and possibly some other BSD systems - if zlib is
 * installed.  If you *must* have HAVE_UNISTD_H defined before including
 * "wtap-int.h", put "file_error()" into a file by itself, which can
 * cheerfully include "wtap.h" and get "gzseek()" misdeclared, and include
 * just "zlib.h" in this file - *after* undefining HAVE_UNISTD_H.
